### Version 1.0  "Starchild"

desktopgalaxy is a little project, made for personal use. I don't really care what you do with it.

It displays a galaxy that ~~should replace~~ replaces your screen background, which slowly rotates over time. I'm planning on adding some other stuff it'll do, but we'll see. Tested by me on an XPS 15 running Fedora 30, and by other people on some other machines.

### Requirements

- A Computer running a X Server
- Xlib, OpenGL, and GLU libraries for building with cmake

### Future Plans

- galaxy options (spiral, more arms, etc...)
- autostart after x server is running
- installer & configuration files to do this?
- make rendering more efficient

### Release Notes

##### Version 1.0  "Starchild"

- Initial commit
- Bugfixes
- Thinking about future features
